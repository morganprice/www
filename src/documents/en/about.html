<p>Morgan Price Networks is a new company founded in 2014 by a team of experienced developers
  who also have a variety of professional knowledge and expertise outside information
  science. We each have years of experience in building and designing web sites and

<p>We have expertise in areas as diverse as usability testing, web design, search engine
  optimisation, server administration, research and data management, digital rights
  management and intellectual property, editing, Welsh translation, business process
  analysis, metadata, digital curation, social media and much more.</p>

<p>We are long-time residents of Aberystwyth and Aberaeron with a deep commitment to
  the communities in which we live, particularly the Welsh speaking community of
  which we are a part. We always seek to provide quality bilingual web sites in which
  Welsh language provision is central, not just an afterthought.</p>
